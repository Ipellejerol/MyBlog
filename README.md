Hi there!

Im Irene Pellejero Lacueva, I'm a student of computer technology in IES Valle del Cidacos.

I was born in Navarra but i live in Calahorra where I'm studying. Right now Im a 1 year student but i already have so many dreams I want to achieve... Since I was 11 I already knew I wanted to study computer technology because I really liked the idea of fixing computers, and making new things with some parts of the computer. I went 1 year to a robotic extra classes, so I have knowledge about "tinking" with computers parts.

 I also have some knowledge about programming games of game boy advance (GBA) I enjoy doing this because i can make my "own world" where I can create everything I want to. When I finish This degree, I will do another degree of cibersecurity.Because i think that is a very important matter everyone should know.

In my free time I like to read, programming, making my own creations with computers parts, I really like listening to music because i feel like I¬¥m in my own world. But the thing i really enjoy the most is playing chess. I have been playing chess since 2014, and I¬¥m the winner of La Rioja (female) In my category (8 years,10,12,14,16...) Due to playing chess I had the opportunity of going to Granada not only once, i went 3 times to play the Spanish tournament of chess... I think thanks to playing chess I am a very patient person, because we have to think very carefully all the moves...

Don't hestitate to contact me, If you want to know any kind of information about computer technology, programming etc...
